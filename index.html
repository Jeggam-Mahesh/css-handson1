        <li>
          css describes how HTml,elements are to be displayed on
          screen,paper,or,in other media

          <span id="oc">Css is not necessary</span>
          <span class="bg">css save a lot of work</span>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways</h2>
    <ul class="one" id="thr">
      <li>Inline-by using style atrribute inside a HTML elements1</li>
      <li>Internal-by using style element in head section</li>
      <li>External-by using link element to link external CSS file</li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS is to keep styles in external css
        file.However,<span class="bg"
          >in this tutorial we will use inline internal styles,
        </span>
        because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>

        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies
        a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to
        one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL
        to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or
        set of styles can be applied to the element
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
        used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
        should be applied.
